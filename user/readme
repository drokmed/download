This is the default debian linux 12 bookworm .bashrc file for non-root user, modified to turn on color, and adds a few aliases

Download the bashrc file to your /home/user directory:

cd ~
wget http://github.com/drokmed/download/user/bashrc
cp .bashrc .bashrc.save
cp bashrc .bashrc

Make sure you test it, BEFORE you logout:

su - user
